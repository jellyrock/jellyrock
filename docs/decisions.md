# Decisions log

Append-only log of non-obvious design and process decisions made on JellyRock. The intent is **lightweight ADRs without the ceremony** — capture the *why* once, so future-you (and future agents) don't have to re-derive it from the code.

## When to add an entry

Add an entry when you make a decision that:

- **Has a non-obvious rationale** that wouldn't be apparent from the code alone (e.g. "we use task pool children-as-vehicles instead of fields because SceneGraph coalesces field events").
- **Closes off alternatives** that someone else might reasonably re-propose (e.g. "we use a custom translation system, not Roku's `tr()`, because…").
- **Has a constraint or trade-off behind it** that might be worth re-evaluating later (e.g. "we hardcode `30s` API timeout; per-call timeouts are nice-to-have but the cost vs. complexity didn't justify").

Don't add an entry for:

- Routine bug fixes (the commit message + the code is enough).
- Obvious decisions ("we used a `for each` loop here" — no).
- Time-bound state ("Charlie is on vacation" — that's a project memory, not a decision).

## When *not* to update an entry

**Entries are append-only.** If a decision is superseded, write a new entry that references the old one — never mutate the old one. The old entry is the historical record of what we believed when we made it.

```markdown
## decision-id: switched-from-foo-to-bar

**date**: 2026-09-01
**supersedes**: original-foo-decision

[explanation]
```

## Format

Each entry is its own `H2` section. Required fields:

- **id**: a stable kebab-case slug (used to cross-reference from commits / PRs / other entries)
- **date**: when the decision was made (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **status**: `accepted`, `superseded`, or `withdrawn`

Optional:

- **supersedes** / **superseded-by**: cross-reference if applicable
- **related-files**: paths whose existence depends on this decision

Then the body: why, what we considered, what we chose, what we ruled out, and any constraints behind the choice. Keep it short — one or two paragraphs. If it grows long, the entry probably should be a real architecture doc.

## decision-id: triage-opus-inline-investigation

**date**: 2026-05-06
**status**: accepted
**related-files**: .claude/skills/issue-triage/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/issue-triage/INVESTIGATION.md, .claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/pr-review/INVESTIGATION.md, .claude/skills/runtime-triage/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/runtime-triage/INVESTIGATION.md, .claude/skills/ci-triage/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/ci-triage/INVESTIGATION.md

The four triage skills (`/issue-triage`, `/pr-review`, `/runtime-triage`, `/ci-triage`) were redesigned from a "sonnet skill + Task-delegated opus agent" pair to a single opus skill that continues in-thread into a sibling `INVESTIGATION.md` contract. Two discovered constraints forced the change: the VSCode extension does not auto-revert the session model after a skill exits (the session stays on the skill's model), making the intended sonnet→opus handoff unreliable; and Task delegation is one-shot and isolated, preventing mid-investigation scope adjustment and breaking the human-in-the-loop workflow.

Alternatives considered: keep sonnet + Task-only (loses interactive investigation, back to the original friction); keep sonnet + document `/model opus` as a manual step (unreliable in this environment, GUI never reflects the switch). The chosen shape runs full-opus throughout, writes a structured YAML frontmatter handoff file (fields: created, target, branch, sha, cited-files) to `.claude/handoffs/` (gitignored) for compaction recovery, cross-session resume, and `/catchup` discovery, and adds a dedup check (Step 0) that short-circuits to the existing handoff when the target and cited files are unchanged since the prior triage. The four original investigator agent files (`*-investigator.md` under `.claude/agents/`) were deleted; their investigation contracts live as sibling `INVESTIGATION.md` files co-located with each skill, structurally preventing Task delegation from re-emerging.
